#React Solar System 🌖🌍

###The goal of the project was to use the data in the planets array to display each of the eight planets in our solar system, with their own unique characteristics. 

I used React as my frontend framework, and practiced creating and composing components, receiving data through props, and iterating over data using a map() function.   

Fun fact: Saturn has 62 moons!
